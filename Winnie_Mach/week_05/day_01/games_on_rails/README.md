Games on Rails
Games on Rails is a web application with three games

Magic 8 Ball
Secret Number
Rock Paper Scissors
Magic 8 Ball

Magic 8 ball takes user's questions from the the URL as params and returns a positive or negative answer.
Secret Number

Users click a number between 1 and 10. The controller validates the guess and renders the win or lose view.
Rock Paper Scissors

Create a route that goes from /games/rock_paper_scissors/:throw to games#rock_paper_scissors_play
Use params[:throw] as a user's choice
Compare the 2! If users throw matches the apps throw, the user wins.
i.e. If a user throws rock http://localhost:3000/games/rock_paper_scissors/rock and the server picks rock player wins! (Yes, I know that is not how RPS works) Bonus: Set the win or lose condition based on the real rules of Rock Paper Scissors. -->
