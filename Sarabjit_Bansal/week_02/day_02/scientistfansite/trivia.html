        <p class = "p1">Societal benefit - Found in 95% of the world's smartphones and a large percentage of other electronic goods, ARM chips not only maximise the performance of these devices, they also minimise the power required to operate them. The result: fast, smooth performance, long battery life, and cheaper running costs.</p>

        <p class = "p2"><br/><br/><br/>Economic benefit - Over 7 billion ARM cores are sold every year, and this number is likely to increase significantly as Microsoft’s new Windows RT operating system – designed for use with portable devices like tablets – gains popularity in the PC market. To date, Sophie Wilson’s ARM processor has generated revenues of over $30 billion.</p>
