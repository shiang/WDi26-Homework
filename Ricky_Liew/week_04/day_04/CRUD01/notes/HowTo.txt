CRUD Steps:
01 Create database
   ===============
  - ... and seed data > create moviesbyk.sql
  - in bash, type:
    sqlite3 kmovies.sqlite3 < moviesbyk.sql
    ... where kmovies.sqlite3 is the name of the database

  check database:
  --------------
  sqlite3 kmovies.sqlite3
  .schema                        > should display your sql file
  SELECT * FROM movies_by_keanu; > displays all contents of table movies_by_keanu
  ctrl-d to exit

  test in pry:
  -----------
  pry
  require 'sqlite3'
  SQLite3
  db = SQLite3::Database.new 'kmovies.sqlite3'
  results = db.execute "SELECT * FROM movies_by_keanu"
  results.class                                           > array
  db.results_as_hash = true
  results = db.execute "SELECT * FROM movies_by_keanu"
  results                                                 > hash


02 Create Ruby structure
   =====================
  Create the following:
  - main.rb
    add:
    require 'sinatra'
    require 'sinatra/reloader'
    require 'sqlite3'
    require 'pry'

    get '/' do
      erb :home
    end

  - views/home.erb
    stick something like <h2>Home</h2> to indicate the page.

    Set up navigation at top of <body>
    Put the following at bottom of <body>:
      <%= yield %>


  - public/css/master.css

  Test to see that the pages work.
  Make sure all links in layout.rb has a corresponding route in main.rb

03 Create INDEX
